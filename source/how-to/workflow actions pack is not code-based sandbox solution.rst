Deal with deprecation of sandbox code based solutions
#####################################################

Recently `Microsoft announced <https://dev.office.com/blogs/removing-code-based-sandbox-solutions-in-sharepoint-online>`_ \that they will completely remove support of code-based sandbox solutions from SharePoint Online. We received multiple questions about future of Workflow Actions Pack. According to this announce, declarative solutions will remain working. This is a quote from Office Dev Center:

*“Note that currently, we do not plan to deprecate or remove support for declarative (no-code) sandboxed solutions.”*

Wsp package of Workflow Actions Pack doesn’t contain\any code, it is a declarative sandbox solution. So, there is nothing to worry about. Actually, code-based sandbox solutions are not working normally since Office 365 launch. So, nothing changes for you even after removing of code-based solutions support.

If you still any questions about code-based sandbox solutions and Workflow Actions Pack, feel free to comment or send a message to `support@plumsail.com <mailto:support@plumsail.com>`_
